<h1>Hi there, welcome to my website!</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi there, I am a Physical Scientist currently emplyed with Environment and Climate Change Canada in beautiful Halifax, Nova Scotia. My work deals with surface water quality, mainly in Atlantic Canada, though I have experience in a wide range of projects. I do much of my work in the R environment, although I am a beginner at using Git and GitHub to manage my projects. I hope to catalogue some of my work and learning experiences in this website!
