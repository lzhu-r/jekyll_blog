<h1>Hi there, this is a website!</h1>
<p>I'm following the guide at 
    <a href = "http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/"> this link</a> 
    to make my own GitHub Pages website. <br> 
    Testing that I can put breaks in my paragraphs with <code><br></code>
</p>

<p>
    Using a new paragraph tag will also cause breaks, which can be defined in the CSS file.
