title: About Me
---

I am a 20-something guy living in beautiful Halifax, Nova Scotia. I'm currently employed by Environment and Climate Change Canada and I work in the R environment frequently, though this website will mostly about my life outside of work. In my spare time I enjoy fishing, rock climbing, and caring for my houseplants. I also enjoy playing around with R and doing a bit of data visualization. I haven't worked on it a whole lot and I hope to improve my skills a lot over time. 

Please see the sidebar for my socials and GitHub.

## Goals

In order to keep myself motivated, I'm going to set a few small goals for myself. Hopefully I actually stick to them! 

* Write three more blog posts in 2020 (the intro post doesn't count!)
* Use R Markdown to create one report
* Fully complete one CSS and one HTML course on a learning website of my choice
