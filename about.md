title: About Me
---

I currently live in Halifax, Nova Scotia and work for Environment and Climate Change Canada in the physical sciences. In my work I use the R environment often, though this website will mostly about my life and projects outside of work. In my spare time I enjoy fishing, rock climbing, and caring for my houseplants! I also enjoy playing around with R and doing a bit of data analysis and visualization. I'm still relatively new to the intricacies of R, and I hope to be able to improve my skills.

Please see the sidebar for my socials and GitHub.

## Goals

In order to keep myself motivated, I'm going to set a few small goals for myself. Hopefully I actually stick to them! 

* Write four more blog posts in 2020 (the intro post doesn't count!)
* Use R Markdown to create a report (for work probably)
* Fully complete one CSS and one HTML course on a learning website of my choice
