title: A Website Is Born
---

After sitting on the thought of building my own website for what seems like ages, I've finally gone and done it. Well, I didn't exactly build this from scratch. I'm using the [Lanyon theme](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and using the existing structure as a way to learn CSS and HTML. It was actually a bit of a pain getting everything set up on my old-ish Macbook since I was not at all familiar with the terminal. For the benefit of anyone that may be reading this later on, here are the steps I took to get this basic Jekyll theme set up. (Note: I already had a GitHub account prior to using this)

1. I started with [this guide](https://codingpad.maryspad.com/2017/04/29/update-mac-os-x-to-the-current-version-of-ruby/) and updated my version of Ruby, which was `2.3`, since Jekyll would not run on versions older than `2.4`. 
2. Then I followed [this very thorough guide](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) on building a static website with Jekyll in GitHub pages. This pretty much guided me through the entire process, though I did have some issues in the terminal that required several visits to StackOverflow.
3. After this I downloaded and installed the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) and the [Brackets text editor](http://brackets.io/) to make the process more efficient.
4. Finally, I downloaded Lanyon from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) and added it to my github.io repository.

And voila, a website is born! 

I hope to keep this website updated with my R projects as well as any progress I make towards learning CSS, HTML, and Markdown.
